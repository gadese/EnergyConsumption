# EnergyConsumption

This is a simple project demonstration of how I would approach a data science problem. It is by no means an exhaustive study, and aims at providing a preview of how I think.

The notebook is based on the data found at https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=microdata . It is a dataset using U.S. residential data from 2009. 

The goal is to predict the energy consumption ('KWH' column) of a building from the data given. Through this notebook, I first explore the data, then preprocess it for ML algorithms and then train models for prediction.
